# zaidofficial.us — Zaid Umar

This repository contains a minimal, cinematic portfolio for Zaid Umar — a mix of engineering work and photography. The project uses Vite + React for fast local development and an intentionally lightweight codebase for easy hosting.

1. Install dependencies
   npm install
2. Run dev server
   npm run dev
3. Open http://localhost:5173

1. npm run build

Assets & domain
- Place static assets (avatar, resume, production images) in `public/` or `public/assets/` (ensure paths in App.jsx point to `/assets/...`).
- The repo contains a `CNAME` file for `zaidofficial.us`. When you deploy, point your DNS to the host you choose (GitHub Pages/Netlify/Vercel instructions vary).

Notes
I replaced all visible contact emails in the main files with info@zaidofical.us. If you want, I can search and update any remaining occurrences across the repo.
